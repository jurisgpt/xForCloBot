# TKW Partners, LLC v. Archer Capital Fund, L.P. (2010)

## 📋 Case Details
**Court**: Georgia Court of Appeals  
**Citation**: 302 Ga. App. 443, 691 S.E.2d 300  
**Date**: 2010-02-23  
**Jurisdiction**: State

## 🔑 Key Issues
- Whether listing only lender’s counsel satisfies § 44‑14‑162.2  
- Birth of the “substantial‑compliance” doctrine for foreclosure notices

## 📝 Summary
The court held that foreclosure notices naming only the lender’s attorney substantially comply with § 44‑14‑162.2 because the borrower is still given a functional communication pathway to the lender.

## ⚖️ Legal Principles
- Substantial compliance can satisfy statutory notice requirements if borrower prejudice is absent  

## 📊 Analysis
### Arguments
#### Borrower
- Attorney lacked full authority; notice invalid  

#### Lender
- Borrower had adequate contact; strict identification unnecessary  

### Court's Reasoning
Statute’s purpose is communication, not technical perfection; attorney could relay modification requests.

## 📑 Key Documents
- Foreclosure notice with attorney contact  

## 💭 Commentary
*TKW* became the cornerstone substantial‑compliance precedent until challenged by federal courts in 2013–2014.
