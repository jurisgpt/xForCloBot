# You & Bak v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2014)

## 📋 Case Details
**Court**: U.S. District Court, Northern District of Georgia  
**Citation**: No. 1:12‑cv‑202‑JEC‑AJB (slip op.)  
**Date**: 2014-02-25  
**Jurisdiction**: Federal

## 🔑 Key Issues
- Whether naming a servicer whose authority is limited by Fannie Mae satisfies § 44‑14‑162.2  
- Interaction between strict “full authority” requirement and Georgia’s substantial‑compliance doctrine

## 📝 Summary
After the 2013 *You* decision, plaintiffs amended their complaint; the district court allowed the amendment, finding a plausible wrongful‑foreclosure claim because Chase’s authority was allegedly curbed by Fannie Mae guidelines, so the notice may have failed to list an entity with true full authority.

## ⚖️ Legal Principles
- Strict satisfaction of the “full authority” element  
- Substantial‑compliance doctrine may not bar claims at the pleading stage  

## 📊 Analysis
### Arguments
#### Plaintiff
- Chase lacked full authority; notice defective  

#### Defendant
- Naming the servicer substantially complied per *TKW* and *Stowers*  

### Court's Reasoning
Because § 44‑14‑162.2 demands an entity with complete modification power, alleging the servicer lacked such power states a viable claim; substantial‑compliance cases didn’t mandate dismissal.

## 📑 Key Documents
- Amended complaint  
- Fannie Mae servicing‑guide excerpts (referenced)  

## 💭 Commentary
The opinion created uncertainty, prompting lenders to verify the true holder of full modification authority before foreclosure.
