# Georgia Foreclosure Legal Principles

## 🏛️ Non-Judicial Power of Sale Foreclosure

### Core Concept
Georgia law authorizes "non-judicial power of sale foreclosure" as a means of enforcing secured real property loans. This process:
- Dates back to the 1800s
- Allows private auction sales without court oversight
- Applies to defaulted property pledged as security

### Legal Framework
1. **Contract Law Primacy**
   - Governed primarily by contract law
   - Form and substance determined by underlying instrument terms
   - Private but state-sanctioned remedy

2. **Statutory Requirements** (O.C.G.A. §§ 44-14-160 through 44-14-162.4)
   - Sets minimal requirements for power of sale exercise
   - Focuses on notice requirements:
     - Manner of notice delivery
     - Required content of notice
     - Identification of authority to modify terms

## 📜 Deed and Note Relationships

### Security Deed Status
1. **Independent Enforceability**
   - Stand-alone enforceability recognized by GA Supreme Court
   - Represents interest in real property
   - Subject to real property transfer requirements

2. **Transfer Authority** (O.C.G.A. § 44-14-64(b))
   - Sufficient to transfer described property
   - Transfers secured indebtedness
   - Deed holder has full sale power upon default

### Note Holder Rights
1. **Equitable Interests**
   - Note holders have equitable security interest
   - Transfer of secured notes conveys security benefits (O.C.G.A. § 10-3-1)
   - Subject to UCC requirements

## ⚖️ Key Legal Principles

### 1. Deed Holder Authority
- Can exercise power of sale per deed terms
- No requirement to hold the note
- No requirement for beneficial interest in debt

### 2. Notice Requirements
Must include in writing:
- Name of authority
- Address of authority
- Phone number of authority
- Clear identification if authority is:
  - Deed holder
  - Note holder
  - Other entity (e.g., attorney, servicing agent)

### 3. Statutory Interpretation (O.C.G.A. § 1-3-1(a))
- Courts must seek General Assembly's intention
- Consider: old law, evil, and remedy
- Plain language prevails if clear
- Legislative history examined if ambiguous

## 🔍 Practical Implications

1. **For Lenders**
   - Ensure precise compliance with deed terms
   - Maintain clear documentation of authority
   - Follow statutory notice requirements exactly

2. **For Borrowers**
   - Review deed terms carefully
   - Verify proper notice receipt
   - Confirm authority of negotiating party

3. **For Legal Analysis**
   - Focus on contract terms first
   - Then examine statutory compliance
   - Consider both deed and note status
