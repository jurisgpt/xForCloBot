## 🔑 Key Issues
- Whether attorney‑only notice satisfies § 44‑14‑162.2  

## 📝 Summary
Following *TKW*, the Court of Appeals ruled that a notice naming only the lender’s attorney was valid because the attorney served as an authorized conduit for communications, so the borrower could pursue loan modification.

## ⚖️ Legal Principles
- Reaffirmation of substantial compliance: functional adequacy outweighs strict text

## 📊 Analysis
