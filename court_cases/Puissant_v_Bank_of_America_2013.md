# Puissant v. Bank of America Home Loan Servicing, LLP (2013)

## 📋 Case Details
**Court**: U.S. District Court, Middle District of Georgia  
**Citation**: No. 5:12‑cv‑388, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 171396  
**Date**: 2013-12-05  
**Jurisdiction**: Federal

## 🔑 Key Issues
- Whether naming the loan servicer as “full authority” violates § 44‑14‑162.2 when Fannie Mae holds ultimate control  
- Application of substantial‑compliance doctrine in federal court

## 📝 Summary
The court dismissed the borrower’s wrongful‑foreclosure claim, holding that naming the servicer still substantially complied with Georgia law because the borrower could communicate through that servicer, even if Fannie Mae retained ultimate authority.

## ⚖️ Legal Principles
- Federal courts may apply Georgia’s substantial‑compliance rule  
- Misidentification of ultimate authority not fatal absent borrower prejudice

## 📊 Analysis
### Arguments
#### Borrower
- Servicer lacked full authority; notice invalid  

#### Defendant
- Georgia precedent (*TKW*, *Stowers*) shows functional compliance is enough  

### Court's Reasoning
Functional communication satisfied statute’s purpose; no plausible injury from technical mislabeling.

## 📑 Key Documents
- Order granting motion to dismiss (Dec. 5 2013)  

## 💭 Commentary
Highlights venue‑specific risk: Middle District endorsed substantial compliance, whereas Northern District (*You & Bak*) allowed borrower claims to proceed.
