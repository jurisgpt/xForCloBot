# Legal Workflow Alignment and Task Coverage

xForCloBot is built to align with real-world legal workflows and modern legal AI task frameworks. This includes support for early-stage case assessment, litigation pattern recognition, and prompt-based legal reasoning‚Äîall grounded in real appellate court logic.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Legal Workflow Coverage

This project simulates essential legal decision-making steps that occur before a matter is formally classified as litigation or transactional. These include:

### ‚úÖ Case Intake Structuring
Transforms qualitative client narratives into structured features using over 90 domain-specific intake criteria.

### ‚úÖ Case Viability Assessment
Applies Multi-Criteria Decision Modeling (MCDM) to assign weighted scores and ambiguity signals for assessing wrongful foreclosure claims.

### ‚úÖ Triage & Prioritization
Mimics junior associate workflows by highlighting which cases merit deeper legal evaluation or client representation.

### ‚úÖ Legal Reasoning Emulation
Provides few-shot prompting scaffolds to simulate sound legal argumentation in GPT-style LLMs.

### ‚úÖ Prompt Evaluation Benchmarking
Supplies real court-based case summaries to serve as a ground-truth benchmark for assessing LLM output fidelity.

## üßæ Alignment with Legal AI Task Categories

xForCloBot intersects with task categories widely used in legal AI research and model development:

### üîπ Litigation Task Categories
- **Analysis of Litigation Filings**: Case outcomes are mapped to structured features for reasoning.
- **Case Law Research**: Appellate-level decisions serve as legal grounding sources.
- **Drafting & Reasoning Simulation**: Output logic structures mimic motion reasoning and intake summaries.
- **Document Review & Analysis**: Case metadata is extracted and codified from judicial rulings.
- **Trial Prep & Argument Framing**: Case summaries inform prompt chains to emulate pretrial legal reasoning.

### üîπ Transactional Overlap
- **Risk Assessment & Compliance**: Scores help attorneys assess exposure and procedural integrity.
- **Due Diligence Proxy**: Features replicate intake filters used to evaluate prospective client matters.
- **Legal Research**: All decision paths and criteria are anchored in case law.

xForCloBot is designed not just as a decision support tool, but as a platform for aligning machine outputs with real legal judgment, structure, and context.
