# Legal Workflow Alignment and Task Coverage

xForCloBot is purpose built to align with real-world legal workflows and modern legal AI task frameworks. This includes support for early-stage case assessment, litigation pattern recognition, and prompt-based legal reasoning—all grounded in real appellate court logic.

What is xForClo - X = Wrongful, ForClo=Foreclosure.

## ⚙️ Core Legal Workflow Coverage

This project simulates essential legal decision-making steps that occur before a matter is formally classified as litigation or transactional. These include:

### ✅ Case Intake Structuring
Transforms qualitative client narratives into structured features using over 90 domain-specific intake criteria.

### ✅ Case Viability Assessment
Applies Multi-Criteria Decision Modeling (MCDM) to assign weighted scores and ambiguity signals for assessing wrongful foreclosure claims.

### ✅ Triage & Prioritization
Mimics junior associate workflows by highlighting which cases merit deeper legal evaluation or client representation.

### ✅ Legal Reasoning Emulation
Provides few-shot prompting scaffolds to simulate sound legal argumentation in GPT-style LLMs.

### ✅ Prompt Evaluation Benchmarking
Supplies real court-based case summaries to serve as a ground-truth benchmark for assessing LLM output fidelity.

## 🧾 Alignment with Legal AI Task Categories

xForCloBot intersects with task categories widely used in legal AI research and model development:

### 🔹 Litigation Tasks
- **Analysis of Litigation Filings**: Case outcomes are mapped to structured features for reasoning.
- **Case Law Research**: Appellate-level decisions serve as legal grounding sources.
- **Drafting & Reasoning Simulation**: Output logic structures mimic motion reasoning and intake summaries.
- **Document Review & Analysis**: Case metadata is extracted and codified from judicial rulings.
- **Trial Prep & Argument Framing**: Case summaries inform prompt chains to emulate pretrial legal reasoning.

### 🔹 Transactional Tasks
- **Risk Assessment & Compliance**: Scores help attorneys assess exposure and procedural integrity.Legal soundness of claims and controversy.
- **Due Diligence**: Evaluate prospective client matters - is there a case ? 
- **Legal Research**: All decision paths and criteria are anchored in case law.
- **Document Analysis**: Client document analysis - mortage, contracts, real estate, title, recordings etc.

xForCloBot is designed not just as a decision support tool, but serves as  platform for aligning machine outputs with real world law firm workflows.
